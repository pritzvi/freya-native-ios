For later:

The approach (simple + secure)

One bucket: use the default Firebase bucket for your project (e.g. freya-7c812.appspot.com). No need for multiple buckets.

Client (iOS) uploads with the Firebase Storage iOS SDK to a per-user prefix, e.g. userImages/{uid}/items/{imageId}.jpg. Nothing is public.

Rules keep things private: each user can only read/write under their own {uid}.

Backend (Functions) never exposes the image. When you need to run OpenAI Vision:

Option A (recommended for simplicity): server generates a short-lived signed URL (e.g. 5–10 min) for each needed image and passes that URL to the model.

Option B (extra private): server downloads bytes via Admin SDK, converts to base64, and sends inline to the model. (More code & bandwidth, but air-tight.)

Because Vision needs to fetch the image from the internet, signed URLs are the sweet spot: your Storage objects stay private, but OpenAI can read them briefly. For local dev with the Storage emulator, OpenAI can’t reach localhost; so for emulator tests, just use public test images (like you did before). In prod this works perfectly.

What to add to your backend
1) Storage rules (private by default)

freya-backend/storage.rules

rules_version = '2';
service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    // user-owned images
    match /userImages/{uid}/items/{imageId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == uid;
    }
    // processed/derived artifacts you might create later
    match /processed/{uid}/{rest=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == uid;
    }
  }
}


Deploy rules to the emulator (already loaded by your firebase emulators:start) and later to prod with firebase deploy --only storage.

2) A tiny Storage helper to mint signed URLs

Create: freya-backend/functions/src/lib/storage.ts

import { getStorage } from "firebase-admin/storage";

/**
 * Create a short-lived READ signed URL for an object at gs://{bucket}/{path}
 * @param gcsPath like "userImages/{uid}/items/{imageId}.jpg"
 * @param expiresMinutes default 10
 */
export async function signedReadUrl(gcsPath: string, expiresMinutes = 10): Promise<string> {
  const bucket = getStorage().bucket(); // default bucket from initializeApp()
  const file = bucket.file(gcsPath);
  const expires = Date.now() + expiresMinutes * 60 * 1000;
  // v4 is default in @google-cloud/storage these days; v2 also works.
  const [url] = await file.getSignedUrl({ action: "read", expires });
  return url;
}


Notes
• This requires that your Functions runtime has the default bucket configured (it is, since you call initializeApp() with your project).
• In the emulator, URLs won’t be reachable from OpenAI (they’ll point to storage.googleapis.com and may not resolve to local data). That’s fine; keep using public test images for local runs. Use signed URLs in staging/prod.

3) Update your DeepScan route to accept either direct URLs or GCS paths

Keep your current route, but allow images to be either a URL array or an object with gcsPaths. If gcsPaths is provided, generate signed URLs on the fly.

freya-backend/functions/src/routes/deepScan.ts (adapt your existing file)

import { Request, Response } from "express";
import { getFirestore, FieldValue } from "firebase-admin/firestore";
import { deepScanScore } from "../lib/deepScan.js";
import { signedReadUrl } from "../lib/storage.js";

function generateId(): string {
  return Date.now().toString(36) + Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);
}

export async function deepScanScoreRoute(req: Request, res: Response) {
  try {
    const { uid, images, gcsPaths, emphasis } = req.body || {};
    if (!uid) return res.status(400).json({ error: "uid required" });
    if ((!images || !Array.isArray(images)) && (!gcsPaths || !Array.isArray(gcsPaths))) {
      return res.status(400).json({ error: "Provide images (URLs) or gcsPaths (paths in bucket)" });
    }

    // Resolve to URLs we can hand to OpenAI Vision
    let imageUrls: string[] = [];
    if (Array.isArray(images) && images.length) {
      imageUrls = images;
    } else {
      // Mint signed URLs for each gs path
      imageUrls = await Promise.all(
        gcsPaths.map((p: string) => signedReadUrl(p, 10)) // 10 minutes
      );
    }
    if (imageUrls.length < 1 || imageUrls.length > 4) {
      return res.status(400).json({ error: "Must supply 1-4 images" });
    }

    const db = getFirestore();
    const sessionId = generateId();
    const scoreId   = generateId();

    // 1) Create session doc
    await db.collection("skinScanSessions").doc(uid).collection("items").doc(sessionId).set({
      phase: "onboarding",
      images: imageUrls,                    // store the URLs used for the scoring call
      status: "processing",
      createdAt: FieldValue.serverTimestamp()
    });

    // 2) Call OpenAI Vision
    const scoreResult = await deepScanScore(imageUrls, emphasis);
    if (!scoreResult) return res.status(500).json({ error: "Failed to analyze images" });

    // 3) Write skinScores row
    await db.collection("skinScores").doc(uid).collection("items").doc(scoreId).set({
      skin_score_total_0_100: scoreResult.skin_score_total_0_100,
      subscores: scoreResult.subscores,
      confidence_0_100: scoreResult.confidence_0_100,
      full_analysis: scoreResult.full_analysis,
      createdAt: FieldValue.serverTimestamp()
    });

    // 4) Update session -> succeeded
    await db.collection("skinScanSessions").doc(uid).collection("items").doc(sessionId).update({
      scoreId,
      status: "succeeded"
    });

    // 5) Respond
    return res.json({
      sessionId,
      scoreId,
      overall: scoreResult.skin_score_total_0_100,
      subscores: scoreResult.subscores,
      confidence: scoreResult.confidence_0_100
    });
  } catch (err: any) {
    console.error("DeepScan route error:", err);
    return res.status(500).json({ error: err?.message || "Unknown error" });
  }
}


That’s it on the backend: you can now pass either public URLs (for emulator testing) or locked-down GCS paths from your iOS client in prod—your function will mint short-lived signed URLs and score.

How the iOS side will upload (quick preview)

Later, from Swift you’ll do something like:

let storage = Storage.storage()
let path = "userImages/\(uid)/items/\(imageId).jpg"
let ref = storage.reference(withPath: path)
let metadata = StorageMetadata()
metadata.contentType = "image/jpeg"
ref.putData(jpegData, metadata: metadata) { meta, error in
  // handle completion
}


Then you just call your function with gcsPaths: [path1, path2, ...]. You do not need public URLs or getDownloadURL() for Vision.

Where to put this code in your repo

src/lib/storage.ts – the signed URL helper (server-only).

src/routes/deepScan.ts – already exists; updated to accept gcsPaths and call the helper.

No changes to app.ts beyond what you already have (app.post("/api/deepscan/score", deepScanScoreRoute);).

How to test now (no iOS yet)
A) With public test images (emulator friendly)

You already used public links. This still works:

curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5001/freya-7c812/us-central1/api/api/deepscan/score \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "uid": "testUser1",
    "images": [
      "https://images.pexels.com/photos/614810/pexels-photo-614810.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=600",
      "https://images.pexels.com/photos/415829/pexels-photo-415829.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=600"
    ],
    "emphasis": { "primary_concern": "acne", "secondary_concerns": ["hyperpigmentation"] }
  }'


(Adjust your function URL if your export is api = onRequest(app); the path is /api/deepscan/score under that function.)

B) With GCS paths (simulates the real flow)

Drop some files into your real bucket (not emulator) or use the iOS app later.

Call the route with gcsPaths instead of images:

curl -s -X POST https://us-central1-YOUR_PROJECT.cloudfunctions.net/api/deepscan/score \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-identity-token)" \
  -d '{
    "uid": "testUser1",
    "gcsPaths": [
      "userImages/testUser1/items/demo-front.jpg",
      "userImages/testUser1/items/demo-left.jpg"
    ],
    "emphasis": { "primary_concern": "aging", "secondary_concerns": [] }
  }'


In emulator only: signed URLs won’t be fetchable by OpenAI, so prefer test public images. Once you deploy to staging/prod, the same call with gcsPaths will work.

Why this setup

Least privilege: Photos stay private; only short-lived reads are granted when you explicitly ask.

Zero extra infra: No need for a custom upload server; iOS SDK talks to Storage directly.

Clean backend: Your function takes either URLs (dev) or storage paths (prod) and does the right thing.

Future-proof: If you later want “extra private” mode, switch the helper to download bytes and send base64 to OpenAI—no client changes needed.

If you want, we can also add a tiny helper endpoint that turns a gcsPath into a signed URL just for debugging, but you don’t need it for the product—your deepScan route already handles that in-line.

Want me to wire the “download bytes and send base64” variant too so you can toggle between modes with a flag?
