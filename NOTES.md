- firebase project is freya-7c812
- need to set API keys in prod
- have set firebase vector db index to prefilter using brand, check if that makes sense + edge cases

This is how we initialize secrets from Cloud Secrets Manager
import { onRequest } from "firebase-functions/v2/https";
import { setGlobalOptions } from "firebase-functions/v2";
import { defineSecret } from "firebase-functions/params";
import { app } from "./app.js";

// Region matches Vertex endpoint region we're using (us-central1)
setGlobalOptions({ region: "us-central1" });

// Define secrets
const openaiApiKey = defineSecret("OPENAI_API_KEY");
const firecrawlApiKey = defineSecret("FIRECRAWL_API_KEY");
const productUrlPickerPromptOai = defineSecret("PRODUCT_URL_PICKER_PROMPT_OAI");

export const api = onRequest(
  { secrets: [openaiApiKey, firecrawlApiKey, productUrlPickerPromptOai] },
  app
);

Then we use in the right file as so:
import fetch from "node-fetch";
import { defineSecret } from "firebase-functions/params";

const FC_API = "https://api.firecrawl.dev/v2";
const firecrawlApiKey = defineSecret("FIRECRAWL_API_KEY");

export async function fcSearch(query: string): Promise<any[]> {
  const body = {
    query: `Find the sephora.com product page for ${query}, if you can't find that then return amazon.com page, else the official product page.`,
    sources: ["web"], 
    categories: [], 
    limit: 10,
    scrapeOptions: { onlyMainContent: true, maxAge: 172800000, parsers: ["pdf"], formats: [] },
    origin: "website"
  };
  
  const r = await fetch(`${FC_API}/search`, {
    method: "POST",
    headers: { "Authorization": `Bearer ${firecrawlApiKey.value()}`, "Content-Type": "application/json" },
    body: JSON.stringify(body)
  });
  
  if (!r.ok) throw new Error(`firecrawl search ${r.status}`);
  const j = await r.json() as any;
  const webResults: any[] = j?.data?.web ?? [];
  return webResults;
}


NEVER do this:
const db = getFirestore(); // At module level
export function myFunction() { ... }
ALWAYS do this:
export function myFunction() {
  const db = getFirestore(); // Inside function
}
Rule: Firebase admin calls (getFirestore(), etc.) must be inside functions, never at module/top level. Module-level code runs at import time, before initializeApp().

Do some pre-processing to get brand from user query, prefilter by that and then vector search the right product + set good distance thresholds

Prod Notes

- Need to speed this thing up to <10s 
- Skin Score alone takes 30s
- for urlPicker, need to make sure OAI LLM does the search to confirm if its real
- Use structured output, maybe zod
- Cleanup code being in random places
- Can use openbeautyfacts DB to filter for user needs first (like Vegan)

Next Steps:

- Get the syntax down for adding secret, creating in lib, routes, and mounting in express app, then testing with simple curl and creating document/collections in emulator before running the curl

- Product Fit Score function, this is specific to the user
- Skincare Report generator
- Routine generator
- Then "explore" within the products

- Dont wanna waste CPU time from OpenAI, so do Async polling, and also reduce time, dont wanna spend more than 60s per product call, want it to be strictly <60s.
- Finish the product filling into routine function
